"""
    Starter code for the regression mini-project.
    
    Loads up/formats a modified version of the dataset
    (why modified?  we've removed some trouble points
    that you'll find yourself in the outliers mini-project).

    Draws a little scatterplot of the training/testing data

    You fill in the regression code where indicated:
"""

import pickle
sys.path.append("../tools/")
from feature_format import featureFormat, targetFeatureSplit
dictionary = pickle.load( open("../final_project/final_project_dataset_modified.pkl", "r") )

### list the features you want to look at--first item in the 
### list will be the "target" feature
features_list = ["bonus", "salary"]
data = featureFormat( dictionary, features_list, remove_any_zeroes=True)
target, features = targetFeatureSplit( data )

### training-testing split needed in regression, just like classification
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
feature_train, feature_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)
train_color = "b"
test_color = "r"



### Your regression goes here!
### Please name it reg, so that the plotting code below picks it up and 
### plots it correctly. Don't forget to change the test_color above from "b" to
### "r" to differentiate training points from test points.

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

reg.fit( feature_test, target_test)

reg = LinearRegression()
reg.fit(feature_train, target_train)
print ("slope:", reg.coef_[0])
print ("intercept:", reg.intercept_)
print ("r-squared score:", reg.score(feature_test, target_test))
